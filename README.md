## Amit Malhotra – Platform & GCP Cloud Architect

I design and build secure, scalable cloud platforms for tech companies, 
with a focus on Platform Engineering, Internal Developer Platforms (IDP), 
and cloud-native operating modelsand DevSecOps on Google Cloud.

My work sits at the intersection of architecture, automation, and developer experience — 
helping teams move from ad-hoc infrastructure to well-governed, self-service platforms.

### Focus Areas
- Internal Developer Platforms & Platform Engineering  
- Cloud Operating Models & Landing Zones (GCP-centric, multi-cloud aware)  
- Secure Infrastructure Automation (Terraform, GitOps, Policy-as-Code)  
- Scalable Container & Serverless Platforms (GKE, Cloud Run)  
- Zero-Trust CI/CD & Identity-Driven Security (OIDC, WIF, DevSecOps)

### What I build
- Platform foundations and landing zones  
- Self-service environments and golden paths  
- Secure CI/CD platforms  
- Identity-first cloud architectures  
- Opinionated reference architectures for GCP

### Flagship Projects--coming soon
- GCP IDP Starter – Opinionated internal developer platform blueprint  
- CI/CD Platform on GKE – Multi-tenant GitHub Actions runners on Kubernetes  
- Terraform GCP Landing Zone – Production-grade cloud foundation  
- WIF Reference Architecture – Identity-first CI/CD without service account keys
